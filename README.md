## install debian
I dont believe this requiers much of an comment as we did this during class. installing debian is quite straigth forward
I did however have 1 question, why did we have to install debian in debian? was it a auto update?

## Command line basics
* I was already somewhat familiar with the command line basics from having played a little over the wire bandit during the last lesson.
* This is the reason i am not a fan of linux based systems as they aren't easy to operate, there is a lot of needles complexity involved.
* Optimally i would like a windows based system that has the ability to do everything  linux can do in CMD but also lets you just use the inteface. I am aware of linux systems that allow this, i just prefer the ease of use in windows.

## over the wire bandit
* the first couple are pretty easy as all you gave to do is read some wierd files.
* you acces them in the following way.
```
    $ sudo ssh banditn@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    $ ls
    $ cat filename 
```
where n is the task name.
* there are tricks for future tasks
```
    $ ls
file name: -
    $ cat -- -
```
the -- marks the end of commands and everything afther it is a parameter
#### This next one i strugled with
The task is to open a file named --spaces in this file name--
I eventually gave up and looked online but noone elses solution worked.
the most common solution was
```
    $ cat "spaces in this filename"
```
or
```
    $ cat ./spaces\ in\ this\ filename
```
but this didn't work for me

for context the line before the 2 empty ones had a " at the end but for whatever reason it disapeared
the solution ended up being 

```
    $ cat -- "--spaces in this filename--"
```
