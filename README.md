## install debian
I dont believe this requiers much of an comment as we did this during class. installing debian is quite straigth forward
I did however have 1 question, why did we have to install debian in debian? was it a auto update?

## Command line basics
* I was already somewhat familiar with the command line basics from having played a little over the wire bandit during the last lesson.
* This is the reason i am not a fan of linux based systems as they aren't easy to operate, there is a lot of needles complexity involved.
* Optimally i would like a windows based system that has the ability to do everything  linux can do in CMD but also lets you just use the inteface. I am aware of linux systems that allow this, i just prefer the ease of use in windows.

## over the wire bandit
* the first couple are pretty easy as all you gave to do is read some wierd files.
* you acces them in the following way.
```
    $ sudo ssh banditn@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    $ ls
    $ cat filename 
```
